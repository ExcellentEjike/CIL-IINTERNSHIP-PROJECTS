# My README Task

## This README contains all my tasks

* Create a README file.
* Add two headers. 
* Add four headers.
* Add a paragraph.

To create a README file, use a text editor like "nano", "vi" or "emacs" as a command with README.md and press "Enter". To add a header, use hash (#) as justaposed to H1 in HTML. So, ## will represent H2 as found in HTML and so on. For bulletpoint, use either asteriks (*) or a hyphen (-) at the beginning of the line with a space. To create a paragraph in markdown, use or more lines of consecutive texts. To save a file, in nano text editor, use "Ctrl + O" and press "Enter" then use "Ctrl + x" to exit. For emacs text editor, save a file with "Ctrl + x + c" and say Yes to the prompt that pops up. For vi text editor, press the "escape" key, the n type ":x" and press "Enter".

Posting a Letter – An Open System Interconnectivity (OSI) Model Analogy
The following step in posting a physical letter is analogous to the layers in the OSI model:
•	 You write a letter
•	Put it in an envelope
•	You indicate the sender’s address at the back and the receivers at the front of the envelope
•	 You place a stamp on the letter
•	You take it to the local post office
•	The staff arranges the letter where it needs to go and put it on the right truck
•	It gets delivered at the destination local post office
•	A post man takes the letter to the intended receiver’s address.
This is synonymous to the OSI model, and we can summarize the main components as:
•	Letter		- (letter written)
•	Packaging	- (Envelope or box)
•	Addressing	- (Local/international)
•	Stamp		- (stamps/payment varies)
•	Post Office	- (Post office, post box, pickup, bike messenger)
•	Transportation	- (Truck, plane, train, ship, or a combination)
•	Delivery	- (House, business, PO Box)

1.	Scrum Definition
Scrum is a software product development methodology that groups software engineers into teams to achieve a common goal: a market-ready product. It's a popular branch of agile software development. Scrum is a light-weight agile methodology tool. 


Benefits of Scrum
•	Scrum teams are ideal for developers who wish to make their own decisions. Team morale is usually high.
•	Even though the project is still underway, each sprint yields a market-ready product. To ensure a high-quality, low-risk product, the highest priority criteria are handled first.
•	The incremental procedure cuts the time to market in half to three quarters. Requirements can be given as needed because the product owner is part of the scrum team. Scrum projects often realize a higher return on investment (ROI). This is attributed to:
o	Decreased time to market.
o	Early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less costly.
o	Defects that are fewer and less costly.
o	Projects failing early and quickly when it’s less costly.
•	Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
•	Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
