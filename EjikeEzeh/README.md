# My README Task

## This README contains all my tasks

* Create a README file.
* Add two headers. 
* Add four headers.
* Add a paragraph.

To create a README file, use a text editor like "nano", "vi" or "emacs" as a command with README.md and press "Enter". To add a header, use hash (#) as justaposed to H1 in HTML. So, ## will represent H2 as found in HTML and so on. For bulletpoint, use either asteriks (*) or a hyphen (-) at the beginning of the line with a space. To create a paragraph in markdown, use or more lines of consecutive texts. To save a file, in nano text editor, use "Ctrl + O" and press "Enter" then use "Ctrl + x" to exit. For emacs text editor, save a file with "Ctrl + x + c" and say Yes to the prompt that pops up. For vi text editor, press the "escape" key, the n type ":x" and press "Enter".
